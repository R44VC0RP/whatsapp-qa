Embedding Wikipedia articles for search
Embedding Wikipedia articles for search
This notebook shows how we prepared a dataset of Wikipedia articles for search, used in
Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb
.
Procedure:
1
. 
Prerequisites: Import libraries, set API key (if needed)
2
. 
Collect: We download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics
3
. 
Chunk: Documents are split into short, semi-self-contained sections to be embedded
4
. 
Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API
5
. 
Store: Embeddings are saved in a CSV file (for large datasets, use a vector database)

2. Chunk documents
2. Chunk documents
Now that we have our reference documents, we need to prepare them for search.
Because GPT can only read a limited amount of text at once, we'll split each document into chunks short
enough to be read.
For this specific example on Wikipedia articles, we'll:
Discard less relevant-looking sections like External Links and Footnotes
Clean up the text by removing reference tags (e.g., 
), whitespace, and super short sections
Split each article into sections
Prepend titles and subtitles to each section's text, to help GPT understand the context
If a section is long (say, > 1,600 tokens), we'll recursively split it into smaller sections, trying to split along
semantic boundaries like paragraphs

Next, we'll recursively split long sections into smaller sections.
There's no perfect recipe for splitting text into sections.
Some tradeoffs include:
Longer sections may be better for questions that require more context
Longer sections may be worse for retrieval, as they may have more topics muddled together
Shorter sections are better for reducing costs (which are proportional to the number of tokens)
Shorter sections allow more sections to be retrieved, which may help with recall
Overlapping sections may help prevent answers from being cut by section boundaries
Here, we'll use a simple approach and limit sections to 1,600 tokens each, recursively halving any sections that
are too long. To avoid cutting in the middle of useful sentences, we'll split along paragraph boundaries when
possible.

On 27 May 2010, [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] stated during a visit to [
[Lviv]] that Ukraine "will start working on the official nomination of our country as the
holder of the Winter Olympic Games in [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]".
In September 2012, [[government of Ukraine]] approved a document about the technical-econ
omic substantiation of the national project "Olympic Hope 2022". This was announced by Vl
adyslav Kaskiv, the head of Ukraine´s Derzhinvestproekt (State investment project). The o
rganizers announced on their website venue plans featuring Lviv as the host city and loca
tion for the "ice sport" venues, [[Volovets]] (around {{convert|185|km|mi|abbr=on}} from
 
Lviv) as venue for the [[Alpine skiing]] competitions and [[Tysovets, Skole Raion|Tysovet
s]] (around {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lviv) as venue for all other "snow sport"
 
competitions. By March 2013 no other preparations than the feasibility study had been app
roved.
On 24 October 2013, session of the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution "About submissi
on to the International Olympic Committee for nomination of city to participate in the pr
ocedure for determining the host city of Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2022".
On 5 November 2013, it was confirmed that Lviv was bidding to host the [[2022 Winter Olym
pics]]. Lviv would host the ice sport events, while the skiing events would be held in th
e [[Carpathian]] mountains. This was the first bid Ukraine had ever submitted for an Olym
pic Games.
On 30 June 2014, the International Olympic Committee announced "Lviv will turn its attent
ion to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decis
ion comes as a result of the present political and economic circumstances in Ukraine."
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Vilkul said that the Winter Games "will be an i
mpetus not just for promotion of sports and tourism in Ukraine, but a very important comp
onent in the economic development of Ukraine, the attraction of the investments, the crea3. Embed document chunks
3. Embed document chunks
Now that we've split our library into shorter self-contained strings, we can compute embeddings for each.
(For large embedding jobs, use a script like 
api_request_parallel_processor.py
 to parallelize requests while
throttling to stay under rate limits.)

Because this example only uses a few thousand strings, we'll store them in a CSV file.
(For larger datasets, use a vector database, which will be more performant.)
