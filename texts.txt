In this guide, we will explain the information and directions you need to know about the Jamarat on your trip.\n\n7\n\nWhat is the stoning of the Jamaraat?\n\nThrowing stones is one of the great rituals of Hajj that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) did and commanded.\n\nThis is done by throwing a specific num- ber of small pebbles at the place speci- fied by the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) in Mina, which is called the Jamaraat.\n\nThe Jamrah is not a specific wall or the pole towards which pebbles are thrown, rather the name of the area in which pil- grims should aim their throw.\n\n8\n\nThe three Jamaraat\n\nThere are three Jamaraat which are stoned. They are:\n\nThe small Jamrah: This one is also referred to as the first Jamrah.

Finally, Shaytaan intercepted Ibraahim (PBUH) a third time, at the big Jamrah, and once again he stoned him seven times and the Shaytaan disappeared.\n\n11\n\nIbraahim (PBUH) proceeded to carry out the command and so he placed his son on his fore- head to slaughter him. It was then that Allah called him with the Words: “We called unto him: O Abraham! Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. Lo! that verily was a clear test.” (Surah As-Saf- fat, aayah 104-106). Meaning: ‘You have com- plied and submitted to the command of Allah and succeeded in this trial and test.’\n\n12\n\nWhy do we stone\n\nthe Jamaraat?\n\n1\n\nWe follow the example of the Prophet (PBUH) and follow his command. He threw pebbles at the Jamaraat and said: “Take your Hajj rituals from me.”\n\n2\n\nBy doing so, we submit to Allah, His com- mands, and His laws. Hajj is a great form of worship which is filled with complete submis- sion to Allah and His laws in all its entirety.\n\n13\n\n3\n\nWe remember the story of Allah’s prophet Ibraahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him.\n\n4' lookup_str='' metadata={'source': 'pdf/Full Dataset.pdf'} lookup_index=0

The Prophet (PBUH) said: The circumambulation of the House, the Sa’i between Safaa and Marwah and the stoning of the Jamaraat were established for the remembrance of Allah.”\n\nThis is why, with each pebble throw, the pilgrim should recite “Allaahu Akbar” (Allah is Greatest), as if declaring that Allah’s glorification and love is greater than all whims and temptations.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n1\n\nGo out to throw with your own group and at the specific time which was allocated to your group in order to avoid crowding, getting lost, and harassing other pilgrims.\n\n17\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n2\n\nThe Jamrah is stoned by seven separate pebbles, one pebble for each throw.\n\n18\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n3\n\nDeclare the greatness of Allah with every throw by reciting “Allaahu Akbar” (Allah is Greatest).\n\n19\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n4\n\nBe sure to stay away from the crowd and try to approach the Jamrah from a less crowded side.\n\n20\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n5\n\nDirect your throw at the wall in front of you in the middle of the Jamrah so that the pebble falls into a basin located in the place of the Jamrah.\n\n21\n\nHow do I throw the pebbles?\n\n6\n\nBe careful not to hurt anyone with what you throw.\n\n22\n\n23\n\nThe stoning of the Jamrah of ‘Aqabah on the day of Eid\n\nJamrah of ‘Aqabah\n\nThe Jamrah of ‘Aqabah is the farthest Jamrah when you come to perform the actions of stoning.

The arrangement of stoning the Jamarat has become smooth, safe and easy, enabling pilgrims to stone the Jamarat and perform the rituals safely and smoothly.\n\n35\n\nIt is permissible for the elderly, the weak, the sick, the pregnant women, and anyone who fears harm to himself by going for the stoning ritual, to assign someone from among the pilgrims to stone the Jamarat on his behalf.' lookup_str='' metadata={'source': 'pdf/Full Dataset.pdf'} lookup_index=0

Allah has chosen it for the Hajj rituals to be performed in it and considers the journey to it for this purpose an act of worship by which degrees are raised and sins are erased.\n\nThe Prophet, peace be upon him, said, addressing Makkah, “I swear by Allah that you are the best land of Allah and the dearest of all His lands to Him.”\n\n8\n\nIt is the first house of worship ever built on earth for people to worship Allah and declare His unity: “The first house of worship ever set up for mankind was indeed the one in Bakkah—a blessed place and source of guidance for all people.” (3:96)\n\nIn this guide, you are going to learn ev- erything you need to visit the Ka’bah and achieve all the goals for which you have undertaken the journey to stay by it.\n\n9\n\nWhat is Al-Haram (The Sanctuary) and Why Is It so Important?\n\nIt is the place where it is forbidden to do cer- tain things that are not forbidden elsewhere. Avoiding such things in this place testifies to one’s veneration of Allah who has declared such things forbidden in it:\n\n“All this is ordained by Allah; therefore, ve- nerate His commandments. Those who ve- nerate Allah’s commandments and honour His sacred rites will fare better in the sight of their Lord.” (22:30)\n\n10' lookup_str='' metadata={'source': 'pdf/Full Dataset.pdf'} lookup_index=0

We are going to learn about some of these rulings in this guide.\n\n18\n\nWhat Are the Distinguishing Characteristics of Al-Haram?\n\nThere are a number of rules and virtues that pertain solely to Makkah and its sanctuary (Al-Haram), to the exclusion of all other places on earth, including the following:\n\n19\n\nThe reward for one single prayer in Makkah sanctuary (Al-Haram)—inclu- ding all mosques and houses in Makkah that are within it—is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers anywhere else.\n\nNon-Muslims are not allowed to enter it.\n\nIt is forbidden to engage in any form of hunting animals and birds in it.\n\nIt is forbidden to cut down its trees or grass.\n\nAny person who enters it is safe with regard to his life and property and thus must not be killed or wronged in any way. The Almighty says, “Whoever en- ters it is safe.” (3:97)\n\n20\n\nDuring the pilgrimage season, entry to Makkah is efficiently organized and anyone without a hajj permit is not al- lowed to enter it so that pilgrims may be served in the best possible manner.\n\n21\n\nThe Ka’bah\n\nThe Ka’bah is the direction which Muslims face in their prayers (qiblah) and to which their hearts incline. It is only around it that they walk (perform tawaf) as an act of worship to Allah Al- mighty.\n\n22\n\n23\n\nThe Ka’bah has four corners that are named after the directions they are fa- cing: ¨ The Yemeni Corner in the south\n\n¨ The Black Stone in the east\n\n¨ The Syrian Corner in the west\n\n¨ The Iraqi Corner in the north\n\n24\n\n25\n\nAl\n\n\n\nHateem (Hijr Ismaa’eel)\n\nThis is a semi-circular open space next to the Ka’bah, part of which used to be part of the Ka’bah.\n\n26\n\nThe Door of the Ka’bah ¨ It is located on the eastern side of it.\n\n¨ Its length is 318 cm and its width is 171\n\ncm.\n\n¨ It is made today of pure gold and weighs\n\n280 kilograms.\n\n27\n\n28\n\nAl\n\n\n\nMultazam' lookup_str='' metadata={'source': 'pdf/Full Dataset.pdf'} lookup_index=0

By he enters the state of Ihraam and starts his worship of Hajj or Umrah.\n\n7\n\n3\n\nIt is Sunnah for him to perform ghusl (bath) or wudoo’ (ablution) before he intends to enter Ihraam.\n\n4As soon as he has formed the intention, he\n\nwill have begun his rituals and must abstain from all the prohibitions of Ihraam.\n\n8\n\nThe clothes of Ihraam\n\nThe person in Ihraam (Muhrim) wears a robe which is wrapped around the lower part of his body, and a robe which covers the top.

The fact that you came all the way to perform Hajj is nothing but out of love for Allah and response to His command, seeking His mercy and reward, and fearing His punishment. This is not for showing off or out of arrogance, nor so that people can say: “So-and-so performed Hajj”, nor to be called a pilgrim with the nickname “Haaj”.\n\nMake sure to learn the rulings on Hajj and ask the people of knowledge in your group about what confuses you.

page_content='¨ The pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah should do Takbir (saying “Allaahu Ak- bar”) in each round when he passes the Black Stone, But it is not a condition that the Takbir should be done exactly at this point.

So if the pilgrim finds himself past the Black Stone, he can still say Takbir.\n\n35\n\n¨ He says the Takbir and points with his hand to the Black Stone, then begins his circumambulation with the Ka’bah to his left (counterclockwise).

As the Prophet m said: “From one ‘Umrah to the next is an ex- piation for what was committed between them.”\n\n73\n\n74\n\nBut repeating the ‘Umrah in one and the same trip was something not known among the Companions, except for a reason. After performing their ‘Umrah, they used to per- form a lot of acts of worship, such as reciting the Qur’an and praying.\n\nHowever, if it brings ease to the pilgrims, it is permissible to repeat the ‘Umrah on the same trip, for oneself or for others, if that does not cause hardship for the pilgrims.\n\nWhoever wishes to perform ‘Umrah must obtain permission from the official applica- tions to perform ‘Umrah at the time speci- fied for him.\n\n(Click here to download the Tawakkalna app\n\nand the Eatmarna app).\n\n75\n\nWhoever wants to perform ‘Umrah and takes the official permit, must leave the boundaries of the Sanctuary (Haram) to enter the state of Ihraam from there. He can, for example, go out to the mosque of ‘Aishah - may Allah be pleased with her - in Al-Tan’im and enter Ihraam from there.\n\nTo see how to reach the mosque of ‘Aishah, may\n\nAllah be pleased with her.\n\nClick here\n\n76' lookup_str='' metadata={'source': 'pdf/Full Dataset.pdf'} lookup_index=0
